/**
 * The Android notification channel, named by BOTH sides of the push.
 *
 * Android 8+ posts every notification to a channel, and the channel — not the
 * message — carries the importance, the sound and the per-app switch a person
 * sees in system settings. A send that names no channel is not rejected: it goes
 * to whichever fallback the transport owns (`fcm_fallback_notification_channel`
 * when FCM displays it, expo-notifications' own equivalent when that does), both
 * of which Android labels **"Miscellaneous"**. That is what was happening here —
 * the app created a channel called "Default" that nothing ever posted to,
 * because the server sent no channel id at all. Nothing failed. The
 * notifications arrived, correctly worded, in a drawer nobody recognised.
 *
 * Neither side can check the other at runtime, so the id lives here and both
 * import it. All three Sabeel apps use the same id deliberately; channel ids are
 * namespaced per application, so they cannot collide.
 *
 * HIGH, and right the FIRST time: Android fixes a channel's importance when it
 * is created, and an app may lower it afterwards but may never raise it — only
 * the person can. That is also why this is a NEW id rather than a repair of
 * `'default'`, which already exists at DEFAULT importance on every device that
 * has run the app. See `registerPush` for the deletion of the old one.
