/**
 * THE visual/layout regression harness. Every screen, every width, looked at
 * AND checked.
 *
 *   npm run test:screens                      the CI sweep
 *   SWEEP_WIDTHS=320 npm run test:screens     one width, for a tight loop
 *
 * It exists because `CLAUDE.md` named a multi-width sweep the highest-value
 * testing work missing from this repo: `scripts/web-e2e.mjs` proves the FLOWS
 * but looks at one 420x860 viewport, so every layout decision on the other side
 * of the breakpoint shipped unphotographed and unchecked.
 *
 * A TOUR THAT CANNOT FAIL IS A SCREENSHOT GENERATOR. So this one asserts and
 * exits non-zero, and `functions/test/unit/ci-coverage.test.ts` fails if CI ever
 * stops running it. Both of the holes found in it so far were found by
 * deliberately breaking a screen and watching it go red — do that again after
 * changing a check; each one is recorded at the check it belongs to.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, and the bug each one is here for:
 *   - the page never scrolls sideways      the classic responsive failure a
 *                                          top-of-page shot never reveals
 *   - nothing extends past the right edge  react-native-web's vertical
 *                                          ScrollView sets overflow-x: hidden,
 *                                          so an over-wide row is sliced off in
 *                                          silence and the page width above
 *                                          never moves
 *   - no two same-layer controls overlap   crowding that appears at one width
 *                                          and not another
 *   - every screen has a way out           a pushed screen with no header Back
 *                                          is a dead end on a phone browser,
 *                                          where there is no hardware Back
 *                                          either; the root answers with Sign out
 *   - the layout that width should produce  buttons stretch below the breakpoint
 *     actually rendered                    and hug their label above it; card
 *                                          grids stack below and flow above —
 *                                          checked against the breakpoint READ
 *                                          FROM SOURCE
 *   - a native field fits its own value    a field squashed by a flex row
 *                                          neither bleeds nor overlaps, so
 *                                          nothing else here can see it
 *   - targets under 44px are REPORTED      not failed — informational
 *
 * Deliberately NOT checked: a generic "is any text truncated". Every
 * `numberOfLines` in this app is an intentional clamp (the picker's field, an
 * entry's note, a rejection reason), so the check would fire on correct code at
 * every width and drown the real signal. Nor is kanban's "no interactive content
 * nested inside a <button>" ported: this app sets no `accessibilityRole`, so
 * react-native-web emits `<div tabindex>` rather than `<button>`, and the one
 * nesting it does have — the picker's backdrop Pressable wrapping the sheet and
 * its TextInput — is the correct dismiss pattern, not the invalid-HTML bug that
 * check exists for. A check that fires on correct code is worse than no check.
 *
 * A SCREEN WITH AN EDITOR OPEN IS A DIFFERENT SCREEN. The searchable picker is
 * a modal with a text field over a capped list; the review screen grows a reason
 * box and two more buttons only once a timesheet is submitted. Those rows exist
 * in no other state and 320px is where they run out of room, so they are toured
 * explicitly rather than trusted because the screen underneath them measured fine.
 *
 * Seeding goes through the Admin SDK: deterministic, seconds not minutes, and
 * rules would refuse most of it from a client anyway. The shapes seeded are the
 * ones that BREAK layouts — the longest realistic activity name, a note longer
 * than its row, a rejection reason of real length, a week with nothing in it —
 * not tidy ones. Accounts are still provisioned through the UI, because
 * `onUserCreate` is the sole provisioner and a hand-written user doc would be a
 * shape production never produces.
