## Deploy log

- 2026-07-16 — **First live deploy** to `sabeel-institute-time-tracker`. Firestore
  rules + indexes, all 6 Cloud Functions (us-central1, nodejs22), and Hosting
  (https://sabeel-institute-time-tracker.web.app, HTTP 200). Functions are now
  bundled with esbuild (commit de32168) so Cloud Build resolves the private
  `@sabeel/shared` workspace package. Drive sync deployed as a safe no-op (no
  `functions/.env` yet). First admin (faisal.shah@gmail.com) promoted via a
  temporary one-shot bootstrap function (deployed, called, deleted). OAuth consent
  screen is **published** (any Google account can sign in; app admin-approval
  gates access). **Pending:** Drive service-account wiring (`functions/.env`) and
  the release keystore/SHA-1 for a shareable Android APK — see `TODO.md`.

## Decision log

- 2026-07-15 — Approval is **admin-only** (Faisal): no org-domain auto-approval;
  every new sign-in is pending; admins see name+email when approving. Managers are
  operational only (activities, reports, entry corrections).
- 2026-07-15 — Phone-first for everyone including managers; web = big screen/print.
- 2026-07-15 — Drive sync scope: live Google Sheet + monthly CSV snapshots via
  service account in a shared folder.
