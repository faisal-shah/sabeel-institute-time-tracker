/**
 * Keep the transform cache INSIDE this repo.
 *
 * Expo's default is `os.tmpdir()/metro-cache` — one directory shared by every
 * Expo project on the machine. That would be merely wasteful, except that
 * `--clear` does not clear *this project's* entries: Expo's FileStore sees a
 * root inside `os.tmpdir()` and `renameSync`s THE WHOLE DIRECTORY away, then
 * deletes it in the background (`@expo/metro-config/build/file-store.js`).
 *
 * Every e2e script here passes `--clear`, and so do the sibling repos' — each
 * one documented as load-bearing, because `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at bundle
 * time and a stale cache serves a bundle built under different env. So three
 * projects were taking turns deleting each other's warm cache, and a Metro
 * already running elsewhere kept writing into shard directories that no longer
 * existed.
 *
 * A repo-local root fixes it for every entry point, including a hand-run
 * `npx expo start` that no wrapper script sets TMPDIR for.
