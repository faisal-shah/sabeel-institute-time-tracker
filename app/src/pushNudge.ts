/**
 * The one-time nudge to switch notifications on, shown on the first screen
 * after signing in.
 *
 * It exists because the permission prompt has to follow a press (see
 * notify.web.ts), and the only control that does that lives on the
 * notifications screen — which someone who never goes looking will never find.
 * This is the discoverable route to the same call.
 *
 * Dismissing costs NOTHING. That is the whole point of asking on our own card
 * before the browser's: a "not now" here is free and repeatable, while a
 * dismissed browser or OS dialog can never be raised again. The notifications
 * screen always offers the same control, so nobody is trapped by dismissing.
