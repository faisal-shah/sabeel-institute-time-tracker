/**
 * Append-only history of every timesheet transition.
 *
 * A timesheet is a SINGLE mutable doc, and two of its transitions are deletes:
 * withdraw (owner, pre-approval) and reopen (admin, any state). So approving a
 * period and later reopening it left no trace at all — who approved it, when, and
 * the fact that it was undone were simply gone. For an org whose official record
 * is "approved hours", that history is the thing you most want during an audit
 * and the thing hardest to reconstruct after the fact.
 *
 * Written server-side from the document trigger rather than by the client: the
 * client could otherwise omit or forge the very events this exists to preserve.
 * Rules deny all client access (see firestore.rules /timesheetEvents).
