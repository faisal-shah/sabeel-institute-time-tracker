/**
 * The anomaly canary.
 *
 * Backups retain 14 weeks (Firestore's maximum), but retention only helps if the
 * problem is noticed while a good backup still exists. The bad case is a
 * corruption just before a quiet period — every later backup faithfully captures
 * the already-broken state, and by the time anyone looks the last good one has
 * aged out. Detection is the cheap lever: notice in days and 14 weeks is ample.
 *
 * So once a day this counts documents per collection, compares against the
 * previous run, and raises to Sentry when a count drops more than that
 * collection tolerates. It also sends a Sentry cron check-in, so the job going
 * SILENT is itself an alert — the failure mode that hid a broken nightly sync
 * for over a week.
 *
 * Deliberately not a UI feature: "timeEntries fell 40%" is an operator signal,
 * not something an admin in the app can act on.
