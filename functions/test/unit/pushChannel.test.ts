/**
 * The SERVER half of the notification channel contract.
 *
 * Android posts every notification to a channel, and a send that names none is
 * not rejected — it lands in the transport's fallback, which the settings UI
 * labels "Miscellaneous", while the channel the app created sits addressed by
 * nothing. That is exactly what shipped: `sendEachForMulticast` carried a
 * `notification` block and no `android` block at all. Nothing errored, nothing
 * logged, and the notifications arrived correctly worded in the wrong drawer.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS GO RED, because three obvious checks cannot:
 *   - asserting the client calls setNotificationChannelAsync proves one half of
 *     a two-half contract;
 *   - asserting the send succeeded proves nothing — FCM returns a message id
 *     whatever channel is named, including none;
 *   - asserting a notification arrived on a device proves nothing — it does
 *     arrive, in the wrong place.
 * So this asserts the PAYLOAD handed to FCM, through the real trigger. Delete
 * the `android` block in functions/src/notify.ts and this fails.
 *
 * It reads PUSH_CHANNEL_ID rather than restating it, so it cannot catch the
 * client and server genuinely disagreeing — nothing in a repo can, since the
 * two never meet until a device renders one. What it does catch is the field
 * being dropped, or a literal creeping back in, which is the failure that
 * actually happened. The other half is pinned in app/src/notify.test.ts.
