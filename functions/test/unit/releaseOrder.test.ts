/**
 * The release tags the commit it actually built.
 *
 * `gh release create` makes the tag SERVER-SIDE, so it can only point at a
 * commit the remote already has. With the push left to a human afterwards — as
 * the runbook used to say — it silently tagged the remote branch head instead,
 * which is the commit BEFORE the release. v0.26.0 and v0.27.0 both shipped that
 * way. Nothing disagreed: the release page, both APK assets, the manual and the
 * public download page were all correct, and the only witness was
 * `git rev-parse v0.26.0`.
 *
 * So the push moved into the script, and this pins where. It is an ordering
 * assertion because ordering is the whole bug — every one of these calls being
 * present, in the wrong sequence, is exactly what shipped twice.
 *
 * Like `ci-coverage.test.ts`, this lives in functions/test/unit because that is
 * the only workspace here with a runner; it asserts about a repo file.
